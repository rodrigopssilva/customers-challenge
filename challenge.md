**Challenge:**
Create an API that will allow creation, consultation and deletion of Customers
This API should be public, so it requires authentication. For simplification, the resources are user bound,
so each user can only touch their own resources.
Regarding patterns and representations, though better ones might be available,
we feel that the usage of Json+RPC or REST is the easiest to read and understand

Data necessary:
 - ID
 - Name
 - Email
 - Phone
 - Country

Requirements/expectations:
 - Language wise, we are open to almost anything, but preferably PHP, python, Java, nodejs or go
 - We need to be able to run your tests *and* your code, so documentation on *How To* is a must
 - The code should be tested and clean, as we will review it as part of the application process
 - The subject of the above API is very open and broad by design. We expect you to have the ability to get creative

We are open to any questions that you might have!
